    <h2>Personalized Financial Advisor</h2>
    <p>The field of finance can be complex and overwhelming for individuals seeking personalised financial advice.
        In order to make informed decisions regarding investments, retirement planning, budgeting, and financial products,
        individuals often require guidance from financial experts. The aim of this project is to develop an Intelligent
        Financial Advisor powered by Machine learning  models and Large Language Models (LLM) to provide personalised
        financial advice and guidance to individuals. By leveraging NLP and machine learning techniques, the Intelligent
        Financial Advisor will assist users in making informed financial decisions and achieving their financial goals.

        The primary objective of an AI-driven financial advisor is to help individuals and organisations make informed
        financial decisions,  enabling real-time decision-making and continuous monitoring of financial markets.</p>
